 The program defines a class called "Form1", which inherits from the "Form" class in C#.

The class has several private variables, including "numar1" and "numar2", which store the operands for arithmetic operations, "operatie", which stores the current arithmetic operation being performed, and "virgula" and "zecimale", which are used to handle decimal points in input numbers.

The program has several methods that handle button clicks, including "button8_Click" (which handles digit buttons), "button11_Click" (which handles arithmetic operator buttons), "button15_Click" (which handles the decimal point button), "button16_Click" (which handles the equals button), and "button17_Click" (which handles the clear button).
